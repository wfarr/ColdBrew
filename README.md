# Cold Brew

I like to drink cold brew. On days I have it, I often drink a few pints and get all jittery and have trouble sleeping that night.

I also really hate when applications don't have retina menu bar icons, or icons that look not so great.

So I hacked together this not-very-good application to scratch an itch.

Should you use it? Probably not. Other folks have likely made better replacements for Caffeine.app than I.
